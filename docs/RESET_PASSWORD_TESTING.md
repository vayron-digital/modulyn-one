# Reset Password Testing Guide

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Reset password links were working like magic links, automatically logging users in instead of taking them to the password reset interface.

**Solution**: Modified the reset password flow to:
1. Validate the reset link without auto-login
2. Show a password reset form instead of auto-login
3. Only update the password when the user submits the form

## Testing Steps

### 1. Request Password Reset

1. Go to `/forgot-password`
2. Enter a valid email address
3. Click "Send reset instructions"
4. Verify you see the success message
5. Check your email (or Inbucket at `http://localhost:54324`)

### 2. Test Reset Link Behavior

**Before Fix**: Clicking the reset link would automatically log you in and redirect to dashboard.

**After Fix**: Clicking the reset link should:
1. Show "Validating reset link..." loading state
2. Take you to the password reset form (NOT logged in)
3. Allow you to enter a new password

### 3. Test Password Reset Flow

1. Click the reset link in your email
2. Verify you see the loading state: "Validating reset link..."
3. Verify you're taken to the password reset form (not logged in)
4. Enter a weak password - should show validation errors
5. Enter a strong password (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol)
6. Confirm the password
7. Click "Reset Password"
8. Verify you see the success message
9. Verify you're redirected to login page after 3 seconds
10. Verify you can log in with the new password

### 4. Test Error Scenarios

#### Invalid/Expired Link
1. Try accessing `/reset-password` without tokens
2. Should show "Invalid reset link" error
3. Should provide link to request new reset

#### Weak Password
1. Enter a password that doesn't meet requirements
2. Should show real-time validation feedback
3. Submit button should be disabled

#### Password Mismatch
1. Enter different passwords in both fields
2. Should show "Passwords do not match" error
3. Submit button should be disabled

## Console Debugging

The reset password component now includes console logging to help debug issues:

```javascript
// Check browser console for these messages:
"Validating reset link with tokens: {accessToken: true, refreshToken: true}"
"Reset link validated successfully"
"Signed out after validation"
```

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Correct Flow (After Fix)
1. User clicks reset link → Loading state
2. Link validated → Password reset form (NOT logged in)
3. User enters password → Validation feedback
4. User submits → Success message → Redirect to login
5. User can log in with new password

### ❌ Incorrect Flow (Before Fix)
1. User clicks reset link → Automatically logged in
2. User redirected to dashboard → No password reset
3. User still has old password

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Auto-Login?
1. Check browser console for validation messages
2. Verify the reset link contains `access_token` and `refresh_token` parameters
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Check if Supabase session is being set elsewhere

### Link Not Working?
1. Check if tokens are present in URL
2. Verify link hasn't expired (1 hour default)
3. Check Supabase logs for errors
4. Try requesting a new reset link

### Form Not Showing?
1. Check if `isValidResetLink` is true
2. Verify no JavaScript errors in console
3. Check if loading state is stuck
