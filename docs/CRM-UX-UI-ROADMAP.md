# ðŸš€ CRM Unicorn UX/UI Roadmap

## Vision: World-Class User Experience & Interface

### 1. Consistent, Modern Visuals
- Every page, every component, every button: pixel-perfect, on-brand, and visually unified.
- Single design system: spacing, colors, typography, and iconography are all consistent.
- Responsive layoutsâ€”looks fire on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### 2. Lightning-Fast, Intuitive Interactions
- Zero jank: every action gives instant feedback (toasts, loaders, inline spinners).
- No dead ends: every error is actionable, every empty state is inviting.
- Modals, drawers, and overlays are smooth, accessible, and never block the user.

### 3. Notion-Grade Workflow Power
- Inline editing everywhere (tables, cards, lists).
- Drag-and-drop for reordering leads, tasks, projects.
- Slash command (`/`) for quick actionsâ€”add lead, note, call, etc.
- Rich text for notes/comments, with @mentions and quick links.
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users.

### 4. Smart, Context-Aware UI
- Only show what's relevant: hide clutter, surface the right actions at the right time.
- Adaptive forms: fields show/hide based on context.
- Bulk actions are always available for lists.

### 5. Delightful Details
- Micro-animations for transitions, button presses, and state changes.
- Empty states with illustrations and CTAs.
- Profile avatars, badges, and subtle shadows for depth.
