# Supabase Storage Setup Guide

## üö® Current Issue
The profile image upload is failing with RLS policy violations. This guide will help you set up the storage buckets correctly.

## üìã Required Storage Buckets

### 1. Create Storage Buckets

Go to your Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí New Bucket

#### Bucket: `profile-images`
- **Name**: `profile-images`
- **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ Check this
- **File size limit**: 10MB
- **Allowed MIME types**: `image/*`

#### Bucket: `property-images`
- **Name**: `property-images`
- **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ Check this
- **File size limit**: 20MB
- **Allowed MIME types**: `image/*`

#### Bucket: `documents`
- **Name**: `documents`
- **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ Check this
- **File size limit**: 50MB
- **Allowed MIME types**: `application/*`, `text/*`

#### Bucket: `attachments`
- **Name**: `attachments`
- **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ Check this
- **File size limit**: 25MB
- **Allowed MIME types**: `*/*`

#### Bucket: `brochures`
- **Name**: `brochures`
- **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ Check this
- **File size limit**: 30MB
- **Allowed MIME types**: `application/pdf`, `image/*`

## üîê RLS Policies Setup

After creating the buckets, you need to set up Row Level Security policies.

### For `profile-images` bucket:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own profile images
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own profile images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'profile-images' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow public read access to profile images
CREATE POLICY "Profile images are publicly viewable" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'profile-images');

-- Allow users to update their own profile images
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile images" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'profile-images' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow users to delete their own profile images
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile images" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'profile-images' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

### For `property-images` bucket:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload property images
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload property images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'property-images' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow public read access to property images
CREATE POLICY "Property images are publicly viewable" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'property-images');

-- Allow authenticated users to update property images
CREATE POLICY "Users can update property images" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'property-images' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete property images
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete property images" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'property-images' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```

### For `documents` bucket:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload documents" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'documents' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow public read access to documents
CREATE POLICY "Documents are publicly viewable" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'documents');

-- Allow authenticated users to update documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can update documents" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete documents" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```

### For `attachments` bucket:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload attachments
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload attachments" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'attachments' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow public read access to attachments
CREATE POLICY "Attachments are publicly viewable" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'attachments');

-- Allow authenticated users to update attachments
CREATE POLICY "Users can update attachments" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'attachments' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete attachments
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete attachments" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'attachments' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```

### For `brochures` bucket:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload brochures
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload brochures" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'brochures' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow public read access to brochures
CREATE POLICY "Brochures are publicly viewable" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'brochures');

-- Allow authenticated users to update brochures
CREATE POLICY "Users can update brochures" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'brochures' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete brochures
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete brochures" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'brochures' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```

## üîß How to Apply These Policies

### Option 1: SQL Editor
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste each policy block
3. Run the queries

### Option 2: Storage Policies UI
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Policies
2. Select each bucket
3. Click "New Policy"
4. Use the policy templates above

## üß™ Testing the Setup

After setting up the buckets and policies:

1. Go to your CRM ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Storage Test
2. Click "Run Tests" to verify all buckets work
3. Try uploading a profile image in Settings ‚Üí Profile
4. Check console for any remaining errors

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Unauthorized" error**: RLS policies not set up correctly
2. **"Bucket not found"**: Bucket not created
3. **"File too large"**: Check bucket file size limits
4. **"Invalid file type"**: Check MIME type restrictions

### Quick Fix Commands:

```sql
-- Check if buckets exist
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets;

-- Check existing policies
SELECT * FROM storage.policies;

-- Enable RLS on storage.objects (if not already enabled)
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] All 5 buckets created (`profile-images`, `property-images`, `documents`, `attachments`, `brochures`)
- [ ] All buckets marked as "Public"
- [ ] RLS policies applied for each bucket
- [ ] Storage test passes in admin panel
- [ ] Profile image upload works
- [ ] No console errors during upload

## üìû Support

If you're still having issues after following this guide:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify your Supabase project settings
3. Ensure you're using the correct Supabase URL and keys
