## ðŸš€ Recent Improvements

- **Admin Sidebar 2.0:** Collapsible, clean, and only visible to Admins/Masters. No more clutter, no more confusion.
- **Supabase Auth: Nailed.** All admin API calls now fetch the latest JWT from Supabase before firing. No more 401s for legit admins.
- **Unified Access Checks:** Admin pages and sidebar now use the same logic: if you're `is_admin`, `admin`, or `master`, you're in. Period.
- **User Creation Flow:** Modern, full-width, and frictionless. All required fields, no more broken profile pics. Backend expects what the UI sends.
- **ON CONFLICT Error? Dead.** Cleaned up duplicate `user_id`s in `presence`, added a unique constraint, and fixed the trigger. User creation is smooth again.
- **Promote to Master:** One-liner SQL to make anyone a Master. No drama.

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of a React frontend, a Node.js/Express backend, and a Supabase (PostgreSQL) database. Real-time features are enabled via Socket.IO and Supabase subscriptions. The architecture supports modular feature development and easy integration with third-party services.

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Supabase Client
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Supabase
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL), RLS, Auth, Storage
- **Real-time:** Socket.IO, Supabase subscriptions

Refer to `docs/charts/data-flow.mmd` for a detailed system diagram.

---

## Database & Migrations

- Supabase-specific migrations are in `supabase/migrations/`
- Run migrations in order for a clean database setup
- Row Level Security (RLS) is enforced for all sensitive tables

---

## Environment Configuration

### Backend
- Set the backend port in `backend/.env`:
  ```
  PORT=3000
  ```
- Add Supabase credentials:
  ```
  SUPABASE_URL=...
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=...
  ```

### Frontend
- Set the backend API URL in `frontend/.env`:
  ```
  VITE_API_URL=http://<YOUR_BACKEND_IP>:3000/api
  ```
- Add Supabase credentials:
  ```
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL=...
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
  ```

**If you change the backend port, update BOTH .env files to match.**

## Supabase RLS and Service Role

Row Level Security (RLS) must be enabled on all sensitive tables (e.g., leads, properties) for security. The backend must use the Supabase **service role key** for unrestricted server-side queries. Ensure a policy like the following exists for each table the backend needs to aggregate:

```sql
create policy "Allow service role to read all leads"
on leads
for select
to service_role
using (true);
```

- Always use the latest version of `@supabase/supabase-js` in the backend to ensure proper RLS and service key handling.
- After any RLS or environment change, restart your backend server to ensure new settings are loaded.

### Troubleshooting

If the dashboard shows zero leads or the backend sees zero rows:
- Confirm the backend `.env` uses the correct `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` and `SUPABASE_URL` (matching your Supabase project and service key).
- Ensure RLS is enabled and the correct `service_role` policy exists for the relevant table.
- Restart the backend after any policy or environment change.
- Update `@supabase/supabase-js` to the latest version in the backend.
- If using Docker or a process manager, ensure the new environment variables are loaded.
