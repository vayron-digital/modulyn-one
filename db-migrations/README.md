# Fortune4 CRM DB Migrations

## How Migrations Work

- All migrations are SQL files, run in order by their numeric prefix (e.g., `001_`, `002_`, ...).
- Each migration should be **idempotent** (safe to run more than once).
- Use clear, descriptive names: `NNN_short_description.sql`.
- Add a header comment to every migration: what it does, dependencies, and date.
- Group related changes (e.g., notifications, leads, properties) for clarity.
- Remove or merge obsolete/duplicate migrations as the schema evolves.

## Migration Index & Merge Notes

- **018_create_or_update_report_functions.sql**: Merged all analytics/report function fixes (was 018â€“024). Only this file is needed for report functions.
- **026_update_leads_rls_policies.sql**: Merged all leads RLS policy fixes (was 026â€“028). Only this file is needed for leads RLS policies.
- All old patch/fix migrations for these features have been deleted for clarity and maintainability.

## Adding a New Migration

1. Copy the next available number (e.g., if last is `031_`, use `032_`).
2. Use a short, clear description: `032_add_lead_priority.sql`.
3. At the top, add:
   ```sql
   -- Migration: 032_add_lead_priority.sql
   -- Purpose: Add priority column to leads table
   -- Depends on: 001_initial_schema.sql
   -- Date: 2024-06-09
   ```
4. Write **idempotent** SQL (use `IF NOT EXISTS`, etc.).
5. Test locally before pushing.

## Running Migrations

- Run migrations in order, from `001_` upwards.
- Use your DB tool or Supabase SQL editor.
- If a migration fails, fix it and re-run.

## Best Practices

- Always comment complex logic, triggers, or policies.
- Keep migrations atomic (one concern per file).
- Never delete old migrations unless truly obsolete and unused.
- If you change a migration after it's been applied in production, create a new one instead.
